# JL Case Studies Plugin for WordPress

## Description
This plugin creates a new custom post type (CPT) for WordPress to present a case study.

The original version of this plugin that I started creating relied heavily on metaboxes and the classic WordPress editor. This updated version is able to utilize the Gutengberg editor introduced in WordPress v5.0 and includes new blocks that replace the metaboxes.
